        <div class="mb-3">Hi there! Thanks for stopping by.</div>
      My name's Gabe, and I started this blog to document my journey as I attempt to become a self-taught software engineer at the ripe age of twenty-five. A little background about myself:
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
      I went to college not knowing what I wanted to do, so I tried out a few different majors. After two and a half years, I realized that college was not for me. I was convinced I could learn more efficiently teaching myself - I just didn't know what I wanted to learn yet... 
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      While figuring out what I was passionate about, I moved into the city and started working my way up at various restaurants. I fostered a passion for food and cooking, but again realized this also wasn't for me. I love making food for my friends and I, but managing a restaurant was not something I wanted to do as a long-term career.   
    </p>
    <img src="img/sunset.jpg" class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5" alt="...">
      <p class="card-text">
       As if it were fate, Covid-19 hit and the restaurant I was working at was forced to close for a few months. I had dabbled a bit with HTML and CSS in the past, but it was during this time that I started really gaining an interest in learning how to build websites. I was completely hooked.  
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Every morning I couldn't wait to get in front of my computer and tackle the next challenge. I was learning so much, but eventually, it was time to go back to work. It wasn't until last month that I decided to quit my job and dedicate every day to learning everything I could.  
      After completing a few introduction courses, I knew I wanted to explore front-end web development further. And here I am now - creating this blog, both to provide some personal accountability and to gain some practice on a weekly basis.   
      <p class="card-text">If you have made it this far, thank you! I'll be uploading a summary of the concepts I'm learning each week, so feel free to check in on Sundays if you'd like to come along for the journey.</p>
