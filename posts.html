    <h1 class="display-10 text-uppercase">3 Tips for Avoiding Burnout as a Programmer</h1>
    <p class="lead">It's a marathon, not a race.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>This week I learned a hard lesson about burnout. Most people teaching themselves to code in the hopes of landing that dream job are going to push it too hard, leading to burnout with a long recovery period. This post discusses some of the issues you’ll inevitably face teaching yourself to program and some tips for handling them.
    </p>
    
    <div class="mb-1"><strong>Tip  #1: Get moving.</strong></div> 
    <p>
      Humans were not designed for stasis. Sitting in front of a computer screen all day working on tasks that can be monotonous and frustrating takes a toll on both physical and mental health. The easiest way to combat this is to find some sort of exercise that you enjoy. For me, that’s running and calisthenics, but biking, swimming, or going to the gym are all great options. Try to find some form of exercise you enjoy, it really can be anything. Ideally it’s something that doesn’t take much time to get started (that’s why the 20 minute comute to the gym is a no go for me), and something that you don’t dread the idea of. But honestly, any form of exercise will probably seem more appealing than spinning your tires trying to solve the same issue for another hour. Exercise is an excellent way to break up your work day in half. The cognitive boost you'll feel returning to work after exercising is fantastic.  
    </p>
    
    <div class="mb-1"><strong>Tip #2: Take frequent breaks.</strong></div> 
    <p>
    An often overlooked way to learn anything more efficiently is to take frequent breaks on a set schedule. One of the best methods for this is the pomodoro technique. This technique was developed by a student struggling to focus named Francesco Cirillo in the 1980’s. He found that setting a timer for 25 minute increments followed by a short 2-5 minute break increased his productivity dramatically. After four 25-minute sessions or “pomos”, take a longer 15-30 minute break to recharge before restarting the process.  This is a great way to break work up into less daunting chunks, and you’ll  probably find yourself pushing to get one last session in at the end of the day.  
    </p>
    
    <div class="mb-1"><strong>Tip #3: Get enough sleep.</strong></div> 
    <p>
    This may seem obvious, but it’s remarkable how many people don’t get enough good sleep each night. If this is you, I’m telling you from experience that this is the most important thing to get a handle on first, and everything else will just fall into place. If sleep is an area where you struggle, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1TxQj9IsQ">starting here.</a> This one video will tell you everything you need to know to get great sleep, from adjusting your internal clock to wake up earlier (if that’s something you want) to taking safe supplements that will help you fall asleep faster and make that sleep more restorative. This one tip is a total game changer if you aren’t already getting enough high quality sleep. 
    </p>
    
    
   <p>
    I hope these tips are helpful for you to avoid burnout while learning to program. I began implementing tips #1 and #3 about 6 months too late to avoid burnout myself, but I’m greatful to have learned these things moving forward. 
    
    Next week’s post will be documenting my process in building a commissioned photography website, so stay tuned for that if you’re interested.

      <p class="lead">My advice for anyone learning to code in their mid-twenties</p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>Greetings! This week I am going to discuss why I am choosing to pursue an online Bachelor's degree in either software development or computer science. Most of the people who get are getting into learning to code during the pandemic are trying to go the self-taught route. Initially I thought this was the best path for me, but I've come to realize that there is a huge time risk involved, which is why I am going with a more secure option. </p>
      <p>We all know that it's possible to get your dream coding job without a degree, but I think a lot of people don't realize how much <i>more difficult</i> it really is. The truth is that application and that sick portfolio you've been working on for the past year will probably never make it past HR to the right people, unless you have a degree.You could really know your shit and be job ready, but if your application is getting put into a folder with the other 500 self-taught developers, you're putting yourself at a massive disadvantage. Getting a job nowadays is a numbers game. If you're commited to the self-taught route, more power to you. All I'm saying is be prepared to apply to <i>literally hundreds</i> of job listings. You need to be aware of just how many other self-taught devs who also haven't landed their first jobs are out there in the same boat. This is why I am going to get some type of BA from an affordable online school such as Western Governors University.</p>
      <p class="lead">What about coding bootcamps?</p>
      <p>I am certain that you too have been bombarded with constant ads for bootcamps with a hook along the lines of  
      "Become a Software Engineer in 12 Weeks". Many of these bootcamps offer job guarantees, promising you won't have to pay a dime if you don't land your dream job. If you are going to try an online bootcamp, I just hope you <i>read the fine print</i>. I encourage you to do your research and find reviews on whichever bootcamp you decide on. A good place to start is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1e24dS8kS5-jS4XZ5NzrnA">this Youtube channel</a>. Foul play aside, the high cost of these programs is something to keep in mind. You can get a full BA from many online schools for the same price if not cheaper. Something else to consider is how rigorous bootcamps can be. They are trying to teach you an insane amount of information in ludicrously short amount of time. This will be your life for however many weeks they advertise. With an online school, you can work at your own pace, which is a massive perk.</p>
      <p>So these are the reasons I am choosing to get a degree from an online school. If you're looking for a cheap school with a solid reputatation, check out <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/">Western Governors University</a>. That's it for this week, happy coding.</p>

          <div class="mb-3">Hi there! Thanks for stopping by.</div>
        My name's Gabe, and I started this blog to document my journey as I attempt to become a self-taught software engineer at the ripe age of twenty-five. A little background about myself:
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
        I went to college not knowing what I wanted to do, so I tried out a few different majors. After two and a half years, I realized that college was not for me. I was convinced I could learn more efficiently teaching myself - I just didn't know what I wanted to learn yet... 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        While figuring out what I was passionate about, I moved into the city and started working my way up at various restaurants. I fostered a passion for food and cooking, but again realized this also wasn't for me. I love making food for my friends and I, but managing a restaurant was not something I wanted to do as a long-term career.   
      </p>
      <img src="img/sunset.jpg" class="img-fluid pt-5 pb-5" alt="...">
        <p class="card-text">
         As if it were fate, Covid-19 hit and the restaurant I was working at was forced to close for a few months. I had dabbled a bit with HTML and CSS in the past, but it was during this time that I started really gaining an interest in learning how to build websites. I was completely hooked.  
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">Every morning I couldn't wait to get in front of my computer and tackle the next challenge. I was learning so much, but eventually, it was time to go back to work. It wasn't until last month that I decided to quit my job and dedicate every day to learning everything I could.  
        After completing a few introduction courses, I knew I wanted to explore front-end web development further. And here I am now - creating this blog, both to provide some personal accountability and to gain some practice on a weekly basis.   
        <p class="card-text">If you have made it this far, thank you! I'll be uploading a summary of the concepts I'm learning each week, so feel free to check in on Sundays if you'd like to come along for the journey.</p>
